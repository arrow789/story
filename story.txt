A man walked down a road and discovered a coin on the ground. The coin had a detailed inscription on it that the man could not read. He picked it up
and turned it over in his hand a couple times. One side was extremly smooth to the touch and reflected brightly. Then man took the coin back to his house to study it
more closely.
